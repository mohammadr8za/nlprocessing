# Natural Language Processing (NLP)
NLP aims teaching computer to interact through human language, whether it is speech or text. In this context we consider to provide you with an intuitive course with sample codes of basic nlp covering its pipeline.

**DATA ACQUISITION:** The first step in each ML/DL problem in the provision of data. Here, with our focus on text processing, we may access data from Open-Access Datasets, Websites, Emails, Books (Using OCR), and the rest.

**DATA CLEANING:** Data we acquire for running nlp algorithm may contain symbols, emojis, specific characters, url, or even misprints (e.g., data acquired from social media) that need to be revomed or correct. in the data cleaning step we utilize different techniques for this purpose.

The two steps mentioned above are out of the purpose of this course, so we will not expand them more and will focus on techniques that an NLP engineer needs to know. In fact, the first two steps are performed by data scientists and Database specialists.

**TEXT PROCESSING:** in this step, the focus is on the pre-processing of raw text. Raw text exists in the form of sentences with stop words and lots of punctuations. moreover, each word may have different forms in the text (e.g., a verb may be in present or past tense forms, so, we need to unify them by removing -ed in the end). let's go through it:

*Tokenization:* in the first step we tokenize the input into sentences and then into words.
